# The Weight of Quiet Code

There is a silence in the commit,
a stillness after tests go green,
when logic folds into itself
and nothing breaks the in-between.

No clever trick, no borrowed hack,
just honest lines that do their part —
a function named for what it does,
an error caught before the start.

The codebase hums beneath your hands,
a living thing that others tend.
You leave it cleaner than you found it,
and hope the next one does the same, my friend.
