# Debugging at 3 AM

The cursor blinks. The coffee's cold.
A bug I've caught and lost and sold
my sleep to find. The stack trace lies.
The logs say everything is fine.

I add a print. I add a prayer.
I stare at code that should not care
what time it is. But somehow knows.
It only breaks before the close.

At 3 AM the fix is clear:
a missing comma, hiding here
for seven hours. One keystroke. Done.
I hate this. God, I love this. One
more push to main and then to bed.
Tomorrow I'll forget I bled.
